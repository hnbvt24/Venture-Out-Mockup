			<h2>Check Out and Pickup Procedures</h2>

				You are responsible for inspecting all equipment carefully and to bring any missing or damaged equipment to a Venture Out staff member’s attention, before 6:00 pm of the date that the item was rented. Make sure any discrepancies are noted on the rental agreement. Failure to note any discrepancies may result in a fee for damaged or missing equipment. If needed, please ask a Venture Out staff member for assistance with inspection and/or instruction on how to properly set-up the equipment.

			Canoes: It generally takes 30-45 minutes to check out canoes. Please consider this as you make your reservation. Deviation from this time may result in delays as equipment may not yet be prepared. Canoe rentals are typically not made past 4:30 pm. Please call the rental center to arrange a pick-up/drop-off time.
